## Project Overview

**Timeless Tribute** is a mobile application designed to help users honor and maintain the graves of their loved ones remotely. With the challenges of distance, busy schedules, and limited travel options, many people are unable to visit graves and perform traditional rituals. This app allows users to perform remote tribute services, helping preserve cultural practices while offering peace of mind and addressing feelings of guilt or disconnection.

## Technologies Used

### Huawei Mobile Services (HMS)
- **Location Kit**: Allows users to view the exact location of the grave.
- **Push Kit**: Sends push notifications to users for any updates or reminders regarding the tribute services.

### AI-based Recommendation
- **AI Recommendations**: The app provides service suggestions based on user preferences and past interactions, ensuring a personalized experience.

### Non-Huawei Technologies
- **AI-based Recommendation Engine**: Provides customized service suggestions based on user behavior.

## SDG Alignment

- **SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being**: Helps users alleviate feelings of guilt and grief by enabling remote tributes, supporting mental health.
- **SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities (Target 11.4)**: Preserves cultural traditions of paying respects to deceased loved ones, even when users cannot physically visit, fostering sustainable and respectful practices for future generations.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration.
- **Home Page**: Quick access to service cart, pending services, notifications, and promotional events.
- **Decedent Page**: View, add, and edit profiles of deceased loved ones and manage related services.
- **Services Page**: Allows users to browse different service categories (maintenance, decorations, religious/cultural, and promotions).
- **User Profile**: Customize profiles, manage security settings, view service history, and log out.

## Design Approach

1. **System Architecture and Flow**:
   - The app uses a client-server model, ensuring that users can interact with a centralized service while their data remains secure and up-to-date.
   - The app will integrate HMS technologies to enhance user experience and ensure reliable functionality.
   
2. **Feasibility**:
   - **Technical Feasibility**: The app uses HMS Location Kit for cemetery tracking and Push Kit for notifications. These features make the app user-friendly and efficient.
   - **Operational Feasibility**: The app offers an intuitive interface for managing user profiles and services. The layout is designed to be easy to navigate, ensuring users can efficiently use the services.

## Achievements

- **Prototype Development**: Successfully created a prototype that allows users to maintain graves remotely and sustainably.
- **Integration of HMS Technologies**: The integration of Location Kit and Push Kit enhances user interaction and experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features a simple, easy-to-use interface with resources about sustainable practices in memorial services.

## Future Prospects

1. **Expansion Opportunities**: The app can expand by incorporating more cultural and religious services, making it adaptable to a wider range of traditions. AI features such as AI grave monitoring could be added to send notifications for maintenance needs.
2. **Partnerships**: Future collaboration with local cemeteries and service providers will help expand and promote sustainable memorial services, reaching more users.
